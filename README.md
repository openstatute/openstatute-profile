OpenStatute is an initiative led by Anbarasan, a Legal-Tech entrepreneur who is also an Advocate by profession. OpenStatute aims to collate Indian statutes and provide up-to-date information with the help of the community. Inspired by platforms like GitLab and GitHub, OpenStatute adopts a collaborative model and version control system to effectively capture all amendments in a versionized manner.

OpenStatute utilizes GitLab as its foundation and leverages the open-source project support provided by GitLab. By using GitLab's infrastructure, OpenStatute ensures that all changes and updates to the statutes are tracked, documented, and easily accessible. This approach allows users to view the historical development of statutes and understand the specific amendments that have been made over time.

Similar to how GitLab and GitHub enable collaboration and version control for software development projects, OpenStatute extends this concept to the legal domain. By providing a platform for legal professionals, experts, and the general community to contribute and maintain an accurate and up-to-date repository of Indian statutes, OpenStatute aims to improve access to legal information and enhance transparency within the legal system.

Overall, OpenStatute combines the collaborative power of GitLab, the open-source project support from GitLab, and the expertise of legal professionals to create a comprehensive and continually evolving resource for Indian statutes.
