Openstatute is an interesting initiative! OpenStatute, led by Anbarasan, aims to collaborate with the community to gather and maintain an up-to-date collection of Indian statutes. Similar to the collaborative platforms GitLab and GitHub, OpenStatute seeks to leverage the power of community involvement to ensure accurate and current information.

By adopting a collaborative approach, OpenStatute can benefit from the collective knowledge and expertise of legal professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts who contribute to the project. This collaborative model allows for continuous updates and improvements to the statutes, ensuring that the information remains relevant and reliable.

The concept of OpenStatute aligns with the principles of open-source development, where transparency, accessibility, and community involvement are prioritized. By making Indian statutes easily accessible and maintaining them in a structured and organized manner, OpenStatute aims to facilitate legal research and promote understanding of the law.

Through this initiative, Anbarasan combines his legal background as an advocate with his entrepreneurial spirit to create a platform that can have a positive impact on the legal community in India. By providing an open and collaborative space for statute compilation and updates, OpenStatute has the potential to become a valuable resource for legal professionals, researchers, and anyone seeking to understand Indian law more comprehensively.
