GitLab is a powerful platform used by OpenStatute to collaborate, track changes, and maintain a versionized repository of Indian statutes. One of the key features of GitLab is the ability to set milestones, which helps organize and track progress towards specific goals. This user guide will walk you through the process of setting milestones on GitLab.

Step 1: Access the OpenStatute Project

    Click on "Issues" to access the issue tracking section.
    From the top navigation tabs, select "Milestones."

Step 3: Creating a Milestone

    Click on the "New Milestone" button to create a new milestone.
    Provide a title for the milestone, describing the specific goal or target.
    Optionally, add a description to provide more context or details.
